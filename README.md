# Password Manager
#### Video Demo:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWCQC9qRxt4>
#### Description:
This is a password manager written in C that is quite secure due to the fact that you must enter a password to access the SQL database. It is about 270 lines and is fully commented out so others can understand everything about it. The inspiration from this video came from one of my favorite youtubers whenever he made a similar application in Python without a verification system. This inspired me to try to make my own in C to make it faster, and because I enjoy C a lot. The video does not show the feature, but the program is fully functional after compiling the main.c file with the sqlite3.h database. It also offers a first time password creation feature if it is your first time running it. This feature was very interesting to add because it gave me a sense of how other programs do things for the first time and then never again.
  
Challenges were faced and overcome along the way. One of the biggest challenges for me was finding out how to compile. The cs50 IDE had pretty much all of the compilation done for you so switching to doing it all manually was very difficult. I had to learn all about the compilation process and different flags for gcc, but in the end I got through it and now I have a solid understanding of the compiler and how to use it with different libraries. I also had lots of trouble implementing the program on windows because windows really doesnt like C all that much, so I installed a VirtualMachine and switched the project over to linux where I was met with lots of helpful libraries like unistd.h.
  
  Overall, it was a great process that was tough doing everything on my own, but I would do it again. It helped my understanding of C and the compiler grow so much 
  
Made by Yianni Kiritsis for the CS50 final project. 
Slite3 library can be found here -> https://www.sqlite.org/download.html
This project took 2 focused days to make
Thank you to all the CS50 staff, I never thought I would be making large programs like this.
Ive learned so much and will keep learning to make even bigger programs.
